\section{Introduction}
The CXI file format was created as common format for all the data in the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank (CXIDB).
Naturally its scope is all experimental data collected during Coherent X-ray Imaging experiments as well as all data generated during the analysis of the experimental data.

\subsection{Goals}
The CXI file format aims to create a data format with the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Simple - both writing and reading should me made simple.}
\item{Flexible - users should be able to easily extend it.}
\item{Fast - it should be efficient so as not to become a bottleneck.}
\item{Extendable - new features should be easily added without breaking compatibility with previous versions.}
\item{Unambiguous - it should be possible to interpret the files without using external information.}
\item{Compatible - the format should be as compatible as possible with existing formats}
\end{enumerate}

These are hard and often contradicting requirements (e.g. simple and unambiguous). When such conflicts occur the highest ranked goal is often prefered (e.g. simple). 

\section{The Design of the CXI} 

\subsection{HDF5}

The HDF5 format is the basis of CXI format. CXI is not really a completely new file format but simply a set of rules designed to create HDF5 files with a common structure and to allow a uniform and consistent interpretation of such files.

HDF5 was chosen as the basis because it is a widely used high
performance scientific data format which many programs can already, at
least partially,  read and write. It also brings with it the almost
automatical fulfilment of requirements 2, 3 and 4. HDF5 version 1.8 or
higher is required as previous versions don't support all features
required by CXI.

\subsection{NeXus}
Another important influence in the design of CXI is the NeXus file format for neutron, x-ray and muon science.
As CXI, NeXus is also based on HDF5 (although it can use others basis formats such as XML) and shares many of the goals of CXI, with one important exception - it is {\em not} a simple format. All NeXus file require attributes in HDF5 files and using many existing programs it is laborious and hard, if not outright impossible, to create such attributes. The large scope of NeXus also results in files that can be complex to read and interpret.

NeXus classes are the fundamental pieces that make up NeXus files. The documentation for the classes can be found in \url{http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/ClassDefinitions.html}. Each class has a set of members which can either be data fields with well defined members (e.g. the {\tt data} field of the \hyperref[table:data]{\tt NXdata} class), or they can be other classes in which case the name is arbitrary. Each NeXus class corresponds to an HDF5 group with one or more attributes (class name, units, long name, etc...) and each class data field corresponds to an HDF5 dataset. 
\subsection{CXI}

The approach used in CXI is to use HDF5 as basis format and adopt a small set of rules derived from the NeXus format with some additional restraints which should make the format simpler to write and interpret. This allows us to relax the format, making it simple for new users, while still retaining enough information to reconstruct an NeXus compile file if necessary.

Below are the main rules used in CXI files:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Groups representing NeXus classes should be named like the class
    with the {\tt NX} prefix removed and with {\tt \_$N$} added where
    $N$ are consecutive positive integers starting at 1
    (e.g. {\tt entry\_1} represents the first
    \hyperref[table:entry]{\tt NXentry}).}
\item{NeXus class fields should be used as much as possible.}
\item{Each data field must have default units.}
\item{Non default units are defined using the {\tt units} attribute of relevant dataset, just like in NeXus.} 
\end{itemize}

\section{CXI by example}
\subsection{A minimal CXI file}
Figure \ref{fig:minimal} shows a diagram a minimal CXI file. Each measurement (which is usually an exposure/shot) in a CXI file is stored inside a group named {\tt entry\_$N$} where $N$ is a positive integer. The first such entry should be named {\tt entry\_1} the second {\tt entry\_2} and so on. Each entry is a member of the NXentry class in NeXus language.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{minimal_cxi.pdf}
\caption{Diagram of a minimal CXI file with a single image.}
\label{fig:minimal}
\end{figure}

The arrangements of the HDF5 groups is similar to that in a NeXus file. The main difference is that in a NeXus file entries are not identified by name but by the {\tt NX\_class} attribute which is set to \hyperref[table:entry]{\tt NXentry}. In a CXI file we restrict the possible names of a measurement group to only {\tt entry\_$N$} simplifying things by not requiring the attribute. Yet a simple post processing program could take a CXI file an easily convert it into a NeXus file by adding the required attributes. This is the {\em main design idea} of the CXI format and we will see examples of it in many places.

Each entry can have one or more data groups. In this case we only had one detector so we only have one data group named {\tt data\_1}. The raw data is stored in the {\tt data} field of the {\tt data\_1} group. As no units are specified the data is assumed to be in ``counts'' (see \ref{units}). Also no experimental data about the experimental conditions is stored.

\subsection{A typical raw data CXI file}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{lcls_camp_cxi.pdf}
\caption{Diagram of a typical CXI file for storing raw data from a single shot.}
\label{fig:lcls_camp_raw}
\end{figure}

\section{NeXus compatibility}
One of the most appealing features of the CXI format is that while it is relatively simple it can still be unambiguously converted to follow the NeXus format.

Figure \ref{fig:lcls_camp_raw_nexus} shows the convertion of the example in figure \ref{fig:lcls_camp_raw} to the NeXus format. Note that the only change are the addition of several attributes that are necessary for NeXus. This means that CXI files can be easily converted to NeXus, then edited using NeXus based tools if necessary, and then read back using a CXI based tool.

\end{figure}

\section{Datatypes}

HDF5 covers a large variety of native datatypes including integers,
floating point numbers and character string(includng UTF-8
support). It also takes care of the conversion of datatypes when
reading and writing files (eliminating endianess problems for
example). 

Most of the data should be saved in the same format as it was
created/aquired. For example CCD images acquired as 16 bit integers
should be saved using the {\tt H5T\_NATIVE\_SHORT} HDF5 Type.

\subsection{Complex Numbers}

A notable omission of the HDF5 1.8 standard, in which this format is
based on, is the lack of a standard way to store complex numbers.

The CXI convention for storing complex numbers is to use a compound data
type with two elements named {\tt r} and {\tt i}. The real part of the
number should obviously be saved in the element named {\tt r} and the imaginary
part in the one named {\tt i}. This follows the convention adopted by
PyTables as well as h5py.

Below you can see a C99 code snippet showing how to create a CXI compatible HDF5
compound type for double complex numbers.

H5Tinsert(complex_id, "i", sizeof(double), H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Default units for CXI entries}
\label{units}

The default units for all CXI entries are SI base units (see table
\ref{table:SI}) with {\em no exceptions}.

\subsection{Angles}
Angles are always defined in degrees {\em not} in radians.

\subsection{Dates} 
Dates are always specified according to the \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime}{ISO 8601}.  This means for example ``1996-07-31T21:15:22+0600''.
Note the ``T'' separating the data from the time and the ``+0600'' timezone specification.

All of these are mandatory.
They derive from the use of ISO 8601 in NeXus. This way compatibility is ensured.

\section{Memory Layout}
All multidimensional arrays must be stored with the fastest changing
dimension being the last dimension, and the slowest changing dimension
being the first dimension, also known as row major. This is defined in
the HDF5 standard.

\section{Geometry}
\subsection{Coordinate System}
CXI uses the same coordinate system as NeXus which itslef is 
based on the McStas coordinate system (NeXus User Manual section
2.2.1). 

The CXI coordinate system is a right handed system. The z axis
parallel to the X-ray beam, with the positive z direction pointing away
from the light source, in the downstream direction. This is the {\em
  opposite} of the definition of the International Tables for
Crystallography, volume G. The y axis is vertical with the positive
direction pointing up, while the x axis is horizontal completing the
right handed system (see Fig. \ref{fig:cxi_coord_system}).

The origin of the CXI coordinate system is defined by the point where the X-ray
beam meets the sample.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{coord_system.pdf}
\caption{The coordinate system used by CXI. The intersection of the
X-ray beam with the sample define the  origin of the system. The z
axis is parallel to the beam and
points downstream.}
\label{fig:cxi_coord_system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The local coordinate system of objects}
\label{originOfObjects}

For many detectors their location and orientation is crucial to
interpret results. 

Translations and rotations are used to define
the absolute position of each object. But to be able to apply these
transformations we need to know what is the origin of the local
coordinate system of each object.

Unless otherwise specified the origin should be assumed to be the
geometrical center of the object in question. The default orientation
of the object should have the longest axis of the object aligned with
the x axis, the second longest with the y axis and the shortest with
the z axis.

\subsubsection{The orientation of pixel detectors}
\label{ccd_orientation}

The location and orientation of pixel detectors is particularly important for
diffraction experiments.

For convenience specific rules have been defined for the coordinate
system of pixel detectors. Instead of defining a local origin plus a
default orientation the detectors are defined in absolute terms by a
corner\_position plus a set of basis\_vectors.

The corner\_position should contain the x, y and z coordinates of the corner of
the first data element which corresponds to the corner of the
detector. The corner\_position must always be defined.
  
Figure \ref{fig:detector_coordinates} gives an example.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{detector_coordinates.pdf}
  \caption{The coordinates of the four corners of the first pixel in a
    pixel detector.}
  \label{fig:detector_coordinates}
\end{figure}

The basis\_vectors are a matrix containing a set of 3D vectors from the
center of the first element to the center of the second element
for each dimension of the detector. The number of rows of the matrix
(first dimension) is equal to the number of dimensions of data and the
number of columns (second dimension) is equal to 3 (the x, y and z position in 3D space).

The first row then defines the relative distance between the first two
pixels in the first dimension (e.g. position of (1,0) - position of
(0,0) for a 2D array),
and the second row elements do the same along the second dimension (e.g. position of
(0,1) - position of (0,0) for a 2D array).

If no basis\_vectors are specified they are assumed to be:
\[
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & -y\_pixel\_size & 0 \\
  -x\_pixel\_size & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This results in the first dimension parallel to the y axis and the second to the x
axis. This convention should be used as much as possible as many
programs will assume it when displaying data. If more dimensions are
required it's strongly encouraged to make the last two dimension
correspond to the y and x axis.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

All other bits have no standard meaning and can be used for any
purpose the user sees fit. More bits will be defined as the format
evolves so users are encouranged to use the high bits to avoid collisions.}

be listed in chronological order with the first processed used named
process\_1, the second process\_2 and so on.}

\member{reciprocal\_coordinates}{The diffraction (Fourier) space
  coordinates of the center of each pixel. Note that the dimension corresponding to

\member{source\_$N$}{Link to the source used to obtain this image.}

\subsection{Instrument}
\label{table:instrument}

Template of instrument descriptions comprising various beamline
components. Each component will also be a class defined by its
distance from the sample. Negative distances represent beamline
components that are before the sample while positive distances
represent components that are after the sample. This device allows the
unique identification of beamline components in a way that is valid
for both reactor and pulsed instrumentation.

 Each Instrument instance
corresponds to one beamline.

\midrule

value & 6 floats & unitless \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\member{value}{Dot products between the local and the global unit vectors.}

The orientation information is stored as direction cosines. The
direction cosines will be between the local coordinate directions and
the global coordinate directions. The unit vectors in both the
local and global coordinates are right-handed and orthonormal. 

Calling the local unit vectors ($x',y',z'$) and the reference unit vectors
($x,y,z$) the six numbers will be [$x' \cdot x, x' \cdot y, x' \cdot z, y' \cdot
x, y'  \cdot y, y' \cdot z$] where "$\cdot$" is the scalar dot product (cosine
of the angle between the unit vectors). 

Notice that this correspods to the first two rows of the rotation
matrix that transforms from the global orientation to the local
orientation. The third row can be recovered by using the fact that the
basis vectors are orthonormal.
